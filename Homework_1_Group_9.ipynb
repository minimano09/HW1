where the Jaccard similarity was above the threshold) between all the similarities. We can verify this because we printed also the similarity of all documents.\n","We also noted a relatively low execution time for this step, which is reasonable given the small dataset (only 10 documents). For a larger dataset, we might expect a longer duration due to increased text processing and hashing.\n","\n","When using the MinHashing method, the algorithm correctly identified the same documents as similar. We can see that the similarity values are a bit different (this time we are dealing with an estimation), but anyway above the threshold.\n","We noted a fast execution time, which could make sense since the number of hash functions used is small.\n","\n","When using LSH, once again the results are correct. Here we noted that LSH took significantly more execution time. A possible reason is that it splits each MinHash signature into bands, and this step involves several transformations and multiple operations in Spark to create and group bands. Even though LSH is efficient in theory, Spark‚Äôs transformations over small datasets can lead to overheads.\n","\n","Overall, we positively tested and evaluated our implementations with all the three methods."],"metadata":{"id":"QEx6evTJlvy_"}}]}
